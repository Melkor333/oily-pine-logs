botan3 It looks like the build for `botan3` failed. The error message indicates that there was an issue with the `botan` binary, specifically related to PHDR segment not being covered by LOAD segment and the permissions associated with the LOAD segment.To troubleshoot and resolve this issue, you may need to review the linker options, segment layout, and permissions set for the binary during the linking stage. Double-check the linker flags (`-Wl` options) and ensure that the binary is being linked correctly with the necessary segments and permissions.If you encounter this error, you may need to adjust the linker options or review the build process to ensure that the binary is being created correctly.If you need further assistance, please provide more details about the build environment, compiler options, and any custom settings that may be affecting the linking process.
ecl COMPILER-Cannot create executables
botan It looks like there was an error during the building process of the Botan library. The error message indicates that there are issues related to the program headers (PHDR) and load segments. Additionally, there is a warning about a LOAD segment having Read, Write, and eXecute (RWX) permissions, which may contribute to the issue.To diagnose and resolve this error, you may need to check the linker script, build configuration, or the way the library is being built. Here are some steps you could follow to troubleshoot and potentially fix the issue:1. **Check the Linker Script**: Review the linker script used during the build process. Ensure that the PHDR and LOAD segments are properly defined and that the memory layout is correct.2. **Review the Build Configuration**: Double-check the compiler flags, linker options, and any scripts used during the build process. Make sure that the options are appropriate for the target platform and that there are no conflicting settings causing the issue.3. **Permissions of LOAD Segments**: As the warning indicated, having a LOAD segment with RWX permissions can lead to issues. Try to adjust the permissions to be more restrictive (e.g., removing the eXecute permission) if possible and necessary.4. **Check for Known Issues**: Search for any known issues or solutions related to the specific compiler, linker, or platform you are using. It's possible that others have encountered and documented similar issues.5. **Build Environment**: Ensure that the build environment and toolchain are set up correctly for the target platform. Inconsistent or incorrect configurations can lead to unexpected errors during the build process.6. **Rebuild**: If you suspect that the error is due to a transient issue, try cleaning the build artifacts and rebuilding the library. Sometimes, a fresh build can resolve intermittent problems.If the issue persists or if you need further assistance, feel free to provide more details about the build environment or any specific configurations you are using. This additional information can help in providing more targeted troubleshooting steps.
cvechecker COMPILER-ERROR: C compiler cannot create executables
mpfr4 It seems like there were errors during the build process of the mpfr4 library. The errors indicate that the linker input file specified as "\\\-DLT_OBJDIR=".libs/" was not found, resulting in the build failure.To address this issue, you may need to review the build configuration and ensure that the paths and flags provided to the compiler and linker are correct. Specifically, check the way the output directory is specified and make sure it aligns with the structure expected by the build system.You may also want to review the Makefile or the build scripts to see how the paths and flags are being set and adjust as needed. Additionally, checking for any missing or incorrect dependencies that could be causing the linker input file not to be generated properly may be necessary.Once you have reviewed and updated the build configuration accordingly, you can retry the build process to see if the issue has been resolved. If you encounter any further difficulties or need additional assistance, feel free to provide more details so I can offer more specific guidance.

mdadm It looks like the build process for `mdadm` encountered errors related to the linker, specifically issues with the PHDR segment not being covered by the LOAD segment, and the presence of a LOAD segment with RWX permissions. These errors caused the build to fail for both `mdadm` and `mdmon`.To troubleshoot and resolve these issues, you may consider the following steps:1. **Check Build Dependencies:**   Ensure that all necessary dependencies for building `mdadm` are installed and up to date. Sometimes missing or outdated dependencies can cause linker issues.2. **Review Build Flags:**   Review the linker flags and options used during the build process to ensure they are correct. Make sure that the flags for stack protection, format security, and PIE are set appropriately.3. **Check Compiler and Linker Versions:**   Verify that the versions of the compiler (`gcc`) and linker (`ld`) being used are compatible with the build process. Incompatibilities between tools can sometimes lead to linker errors.4. **Investigate RWX Permissions Warning:**   The warning about a `LOAD` segment with RWX permissions could indicate a potential security risk. Review the linker options and the generated binary to ensure that the permissions are set correctly.5. **Inspect Binary Output:**   After a failed build, it can be helpful to inspect the generated binary (`mdadm` and `mdmon`) to understand the structure and permissions of the segments. Tools like `readelf` or `objdump` can be useful for this purpose.6. **Look for Relevant Compiler and Linker Output:**   Examine the full output from the compiler and linker to see if there are any other warnings or errors that might provide additional context about the failure.7. **Search for Similar Issues:**   If the issue persists, consider searching online forums or issue trackers to see if others have encountered similar problems during the build of `mdadm`. Solutions or workarounds from the community could help resolve the problem.By systematically addressing each of these points, you may be able to diagnose the cause of the linker errors and successfully build `mdadm` and `mdmon`. If you encounter any specific errors or need further assistance, feel free to provide additional details for tailored support.

cgit It seems like there were errors during the build process for `cgit`. The error message indicates problems with the LD linker related to the segments' permissions. Here are a few suggestions to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:1. **Check Load and PHDR Segments Permissions**: Review the linker script, object files, or options used during compilation and linking to ensure that the LOAD segment permissions align with the PHDR segment. Make sure there are no conflicting permissions defined.2. **Investigate LD Warnings**: Examine any warnings or notes produced by the LD linker. It may provide additional insights into the segmentation issues encountered during linking.3. **Review Linker Options**: Verify that the linker options and flags are correctly set during the linking phase. Check if there are any conflicting or incorrect options that might cause the segmentation errors.4. **Inspect Build Logs**: Review the complete build logs to identify any earlier warnings or errors that could have led to the segmentation issues during linking. Addressing any previous build problems might help resolve the current linker errors.5. **Consult Build Dependencies**: Ensure that all build dependencies, including libraries and headers, are correctly installed and accessible. Sometimes, missing or incompatible dependencies can lead to linker issues.6. **Compiler and Linker Version Compatibility**: Make sure that the compiler and linker versions are compatible. Incompatibilities between the compiler and linker versions could lead to segmentation problems during linking.7. **Seek Help from the Project Community**: If troubleshooting the issue locally proves challenging, consider reaching out to the cgit project community or relevant forums for assistance. Other developers might have encountered and resolved similar issues.By following these steps and investigating the build process further, you may be able to identify and address the root cause of the segmentation issues encountered during the linking phase of building `cgit`.
